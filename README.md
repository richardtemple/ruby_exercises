```ruby
anagrams = Anagrams.new( %w{ foo echo car baz rat chore bar art tar ochre } )

anagrams.find_for 'rat'
=> ['art', 'rat', 'tar']

anagrams.find_for 'chore'
=> ['chore', 'ochre']
```

### Word Clock

**Exercise**

Convert numerical times into text

Times should be rounded to the nearest five minutes, then described using the following words:

"It's", "about", "quarter", "twenty", "twenty", "five", "ten", "half", "past", "to",
"one", "two", "three", "four", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine",
and "eleven", "twelve".

If the time is on the hour, the phrase should end with "o'clock".

**Examples**

```ruby
Clock.say 4, 25
=> "It is twenty five past four."

Clock.say 6, 50
=> "It is ten to seven."

Clock.say 12, 58
=> "It is about one o'clock."
```

### Fibonacci Digit Count

**Exercise**

One of the problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=25), is to determine the index
of the first number in the Fibonacci sequence containing 1000 digits.

The kata here is to write a method that will take a count, C, and quickly return the index of the sequence
that has at least C digits. It should be able to return the answer in less than a second, when searching
for numbers up to at least 10,000 digits.


**Examples**

```ruby
Fib.first_with_digit_count 2
=> 8
# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13

Fib.first_with_digit_count 3
=> 12
# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144

Fib.first_with_digit_count 10000
=> 47847
# returns in ~ 0.1s
```

----

### Collatz Sequence

**Exercise**

[Project Euler problem 14](https://projecteuler.net/problem=14) asks us to find the starting number under
1,000,000 that creates the longest Collatz chain.

The sequence begins with a number n, then continues with n/2 if is even, or (3n + 1) if n is odd. The rule
is repeated until n reaches one. (It is assumed that it will always reach 1.)

To solve the Project Euler problem, let's write a class with a method that will return the Collatz sequence
beginning with any given positive number. Then add a method that returns the starting number and length of
the longest chain that begins with a number less than or equal to a given limit.

**Examples**

```ruby
Collatz.sequence_from 13
=> [13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]

Collatz.sequence_from 6
=> [6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]

Collatz.longest_under 8
=> { start: 7, length: 17 }

Collatz.longest_under 2000
=> { start: 1161, length: 182 }
```

----

### Number Words

**Exercise**

[Project Euler problem 17](https://projecteuler.net/problem=17) asks us to
convert all the numbers from 1 to 1000 to English phrases, then count up all
the letters.

To solve the problem, create a class with two methods: one that will convert
any number (up to at least 9999) to an English phrase, and a second that will
return the letter count for any number or range of numbers (up to 9999).

The phrases should adhere to the British tradition of using the word "and" like so:

- 413  => "four hundred and thirteen"
- 2148 => "two thousand one hundred and forty eight"

The count should ignore spaces and other non-letter characters.

**Examples**

```ruby
NumberWords.say 916
=> "nine hundred and sixteen"

NumberWords.say 2400
=> "two thousand four hundred"

NumberWord.letter_count 16
=> 7

NumberWord.letter_count 1, 20
=> 112
```

### Amicable Numbers

**Exercise**

_From [Project Euler, Problem 21](https://projecteuler.net/problem=21)_

> Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
> If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a ≠ b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.
>
> For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284.
> The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
>
> Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

To solve this problem let's create a class with two public methods: One that will
return the unique pairs of amicable numbers up to a given limit, and another that
will return the sum of all the amicable numbers up to a limit.

**Examples**

```ruby
AmicableNumbers.pairs_to 300
=> [[220, 284]]

AmicableNumbers.pairs_to 2000
=> [[220, 284], [1184, 1210]]

AmicableNumbers.sum_to 300
=> 504

AmicableNumbers.sum_to 2000
=> 2898
```
